The data have been scraepd from week sales published by the San Francisco Chronicle.

It is available at 
http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/nolan/data/sfchronhousing.csv

We should check that the format is as we expect before reading in the data.


```{r}
sfh = read.csv(url("http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/nolan/data/sfchronhousing.csv"))
```


## Examine the Size and Quality of the Data

Let's check the size with a call to `dim()`

```{r}
dim(sfh)
```

Let's look at a few records at the beginning and end of the file.

```{r}
head(sfh)
```

```{r}
tail(sfh)
```

We can count the number of sales in each county and city.
This will also help us see if there are any issues with county or city names.

```{r}
table(sfh$county)
```

```{r}
table(sfh$city)
```
